# Patient Dashboard - Pablo Munoz-Evers

> Run `npm run dev` to start project locally.

This application is for display purposes only -- the buttons, drop-down menus, etc. do not do anything, and only the patient information for Jessica Taylor is displayed. Functionality can be added to these elements as needed.
