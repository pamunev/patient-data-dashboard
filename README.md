# Patient Dashboard - Pablo Munoz-Evers

> Run `npm run dev` to start project locally.

This application is for display purposes only -- the buttons, drop-down menus, etc. do not do anything, and only the patient information for Jessica Taylor is displayed. Functionality can be added to these elements as needed.

However, the graph and data are populated through an API call to https://fedskillstest.coalitiontechnologies.workers.dev.

> Note: If that data source stops working (likely due to deactivation), use https://run.mocky.io/v3/534148d7-98e5-4f3d-8bba-2ff970d0b6f7. This is the URL that is commented out under the URL for the original API in the fetchPatientData async function, located in the PatientData.jsx file.
